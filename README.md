### Hi, my name is Stijn!

I'm currently working on [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars) - a lightning fast DataFrame library.
We aim to transform the data processing landscape with a tool that achieves maximum performance by fully utilizing your machine's resources.

My main interest as a developer is creating a great developer experience through clean code and great tooling.
See my [python-ci](https://github.com/stinodego/python-ci) repo for my favorite tools in the Python space.

My background is in artificial intelligence and data science.
Before joining Polars full-time, I worked for [Albert Heijn](https://www.ah.nl/) as a machine learning engineer.
Before that, I was a data science consultant at [Xomnia](https://www.xomnia.com/).

Besides coding, some of my interests include singing, dance, and martial arts.
