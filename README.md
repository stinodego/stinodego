### Hi, my name is Stijn!

I'm an experienced machine learning engineer with a solid background in data science and Python software engineering.
I work with great attention to detail and have a strong drive to make anything I work on a success.

I'm currently open for new job opportunities.
My previous role was a software engineering position at [Polars](https://pola.rs) - the company behind the lightning fast DataFrame library.
Before joining Polars, I worked for [Albert Heijn](https://www.ah.nl/) as a machine learning engineer.
Before that, I was a data science consultant at [Xomnia](https://www.xomnia.com/).

Besides coding, some of my interests include singing, dance, and martial arts.
